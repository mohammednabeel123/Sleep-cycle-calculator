      <h2><u> When to wake up: How much sleep do you need? (7-9 hours)</u></h2>
      <p class="paragraphy">
        While the general recommendation is to aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep,
        the amount you need will be unique to your biology and lifestyle.
        Babies, children, and teens need more sleep than adults to facilitate
        growth and learning. People who are physically active and people dealing
        with or recovering from illness or injury tend to need more sleep.
